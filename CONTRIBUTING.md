# Contributing to UI Resources Repository

Thank you for contributing to the UI Resources Repository! Here are some guidelines to help you add new resources to the repository.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/UI-Resources-Repo.git
    ```

3. Create a new HTML file for the category you want to contribute to. For example, if you are adding a new Color Palette, create a file named `color_palettes.html`.

4. Copy the following template into your new HTML file:

    ```html
    <div>
        <!-- Example Card -->
        <div class="resource-card">
            <h3>Palette Name</h3>
            <p>Description: Brief description of the color palette.</p>
            <p>Link: <a href="https://example.com/">Palette Link</a></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

    Customize the template by replacing `Palette Name`, `Brief description of the color palette.`, and `https://example.com/` with the actual details of the color palette you are adding.

5. Save the changes and commit them to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git add color_palettes.html
    git commit -m "Add new color palette"
    git push origin main
    ```

6. Create a pull request.

7. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Thank you for contributing! If you have resources for other categories, follow the same steps by creating HTML files for those categories.
